### A VRChat translator built for helping you and the person/people you're talking with to understand each other regardless of language differences.

- **Translation:** Translation of your speech to the chatbox in more than 10 major languages (6 accents of English and 6 dialects of Spanish along with languages such as Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Italian, French, Turkish, Russian, Polish, Portugal, German, French, Arabic, Swedish and so on)
- **Transcription (Just Speech to Text):** If you don't want to translate, there is a transcription mode that sends whatever you say directly to the chatbox. Perfect for people that prefer to not speak in VRChat but be able to communicate with the convenience of speaking.
